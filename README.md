    - For the typical user, current firewall solutions are complicated and if left alone, create a huge risk for user data to be compromised.
    - We want to create a product that will protect the user, no matter what level of networking they might need.
  - We want to build a firewall that will change just as the internet does.
    - New threats become apparent every day
- Compelling Value
